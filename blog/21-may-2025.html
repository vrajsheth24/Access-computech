                        <p class="pb-3">
                            No matter how smart a system is, it only works if the people using it truly believe in it.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pb-3">
                            When we rolled out biometric attendance across thousands of government schools in Gujarat,
                            the technology itself wasn’t the biggest challenge.
                            We needed to make sure that the people using it would be comfortable with it.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pb-3">
                            For many teachers, especially in rural and semi-urban areas, the idea of using fingerprint
                            scanners, syncing data, and accessing dashboards felt very alien. In their minds, it was
                            only something used in big-city corporates and international infrastructure.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pb-3">
                            And understandably so. These were educators used to writing in registers and handing over
                            monthly reports, not managing synced systems, verifying hardware, or interpreting analytics
                            dashboards.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pb-3">
                            And moving an educator who loves their pen and paper to an automated system is not easy as
                            it sounds.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pb-3">
                            We knew that for this project to have a real impact, our work won’t end with delivering
                            biometric devices or setting up a secure infrastructure.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pb-4">
                            We had to also build confidence, provide guidance, and stay close to the ground.
                        </p>

                        <h5 class="pb-3 fs-28 fw-semibold lh-sm">The Challenge</h5>
                        <p class="pb-3">
                            Most of the hesitation we noticed was not a resistance to change, it was uncertainty about
                            the new methods.
                            Teachers and administrators were worried about a few things:
                        </p>
                        <ul class="pb-3 ps-lg-5 ps-0" style="list-style:disc;">
                            <li class="pb-2">“What if the scanner doesn’t work?”</li>
                            <li class="pb-2">“What happens if I click the wrong button?”</li>
                            <li class="pb-2">“Will this add to our workload instead of reducing it?”</li>
                            <li class="pb-2">“What if I accidentally delete all the data?”</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="pb-3">
                            There was also some concern that the system would expose the gaps they were previously able
                            to manage quietly, like backdated entries, proxy attendance, or incomplete reports.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pb-3">
                            In short, the new system disrupted old routines, and naturally, that came with apprehension.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pb-4">
                            We couldn’t solve this with manuals or user-guides. We had to show up, explain patiently,
                            demonstrate repeatedly, and stay available long after training ended.
                        </p>

                        <p class="pb-3">
                            We treated onboarding not as a one-time exercise, but as an ongoing relationship with every
                            level of the education system.
                        </p>

                        <p class="pb-3">
                            We conducted on-site training sessions that walked staff through every part of the system:

                            Each session was hands-on. Teachers practiced on the actual hardware. There was no rush and
                            no pressure, just clarity and support.

                            We also trained staff on basic data security, helping them understand why passwords matter,
                            how access is restricted, and how to handle errors responsibly.

                        <p class="pb-3">
                            We made sure students, too, were part of the journey. Especially in the early days, simple
                            demos were held in classrooms to show them how to use the fingerprint scanner.

                            Once they understood that the system was there to protect their identity and ensure
                            fairness, adoption for students became effortless. In many schools, students reminded each
                            other to scan in daily, it became part of the culture. And most of the students actually
                            enjoyed the new tech available to them. A great learning opportunity for kids in rural
                            regions.

                            At the top levels, we ran workshops that focused more on monitoring tools and
                            decision-making:

                        <p class="pb-3">
                            We gave officials a complete view of how the system works, not just the output. That made
                            conversations about policy, resource planning, and interventions far more grounded and
                            actionable.

                        <p class="pb-3">
                            Our greatest learning? Training alone isn’t enough. What makes adoption sustainable is
                            ongoing support.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pb-3">
                            We set up a dedicated helpdesk to handle queries from across the state. Whether it was a
                            school struggling to connect, a scanner that needed resetting, or a teacher simply unsure
                            about a step, we were just a call away.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pb-3">
                            And we ensured our support staff maintained a professional and helpful tone in servicing. We
                            weren’t “tech support” calling from a distance. We were the same team who had trained them,
                            stood with them, and explained the system. We feel that that made all the difference.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pb-3">
                            Over time, the calls reduced. Confidence grew. Schools ran the system independently.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pb-4">
