                            Managing school attendance for students and staff across a whole state is time-consuming, to
                            say the least. Anything of this scale will understandably be a humongous challenge for the
                            state’s resources and will occupy a lot of time.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pb-3">
                            The Government of Gujarat wanted an automated solution which could record attendance, log it
                            in real-time, and generate insightful reports from all that data. This data can help the
                            state improve their efforts to better the quality of education provided and also recognise
                            any areas where development was required.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pb-3">
                            Our team recently wrapped up this state-wide project with the Government of Gujarat to
                            automate attendance tracking with the help of our biometric devices and create a state-wide
                            solution.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pb-3">
                            With thousands of schools and lakhs of students involved, tracking who showed up was only
                            one piece of the puzzle.
                            What mattered just as much was knowing when something wasn’t right and knowing it soon
                            enough to act on time.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pb-3">
                            In the earlier manual system, this could not happen. According to the earlier process,
                            Schools would compile data at the end of the month, forward it to district offices, and by
                            the time it reached state-level authorities, the moment to act had already passed.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pb-3">
                            This delayed decision-making, and more critically, important patterns like chronic
                            absenteeism often went unnoticed until the problem escalated.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pb-4">
                            There was a need for a system that made all the collected data usable and actionable.
                        </p>

                        <h5 class="pb-3 fs-28 fw-semibold lh-sm">The Challenge</h5>
                        <p class="pb-3">
                            The problem wasn’t that data wasn’t being collected manually. It was.
                            But it lived and died in silos, inside Excel files, paper logs, and local systems that
                            didn’t talk to each other. A lot of data was collected, but many insights were lost in
                            translation from one mode to another.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pb-3">
                            Teachers were spending hours compiling reports. Officers were depending on delayed
                            summaries. And important issues like a student who hadn’t shown up in ten days, or a school
                            that hadn’t uploaded attendance all week just slipped through the cracks. Not to mention any
                            possibility of proxy attendance or instances of identity theft which could have taken place.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pb-3">
                            There was too much waiting. Too much paperwork. Too many things falling between the lines.
                            We had to fix that.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pb-3">
                            The scale of Gujarat’s school network, however, demanded much more than a record-keeping
                            tool. Officials required:
                        </p>

                        <p class="pb-4">
                            Manual reporting simply couldn’t scale to match these needs, especially not with the level
                            of detail and timeliness expected.
                        </p>

                        <p class="pb-3">
                            So we started building dashboards for real-time awareness and to make early action a
                            possibility.
                            Our system stored attendance, monitored it, looked for patterns, and flagged anomalies. It
                            generated alerts that told the right people what they needed to know, exactly when they
                            needed to or even wanted to know it.

                            district. We could display average attendance trends and daily attendance percentages,

                            Our system was designed in a way that real-time insights could be used to make a difference
                            at the ground level. Going beyond the technical, we wanted to help the government make
                            smarter decisions which affected the entire education system.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pb-3">
                            Officials no longer had to chase down reports, they opened their dashboard and saw what was
                            happening.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pb-3">
                            Teachers no longer had to spend hours on summaries, the system took care of it.

                        <p class="pb-3">
                            And most importantly, problems no longer went unnoticed.

                            <li class="pb-2">If patterns started to emerge such as declining attendance in certain
                                pockets of the district, they were visible to responsible officials before they became

                        <p class="pb-4">
                            This helped in better oversight, faster response, lighter workload, and smarter governance.

                        <h5 class="pb-3 fs-28 fw-semibold lh-sm">Our Takeaways</h5>
                        <p class="pb-3">
                            Working on this project we realised that data alone isn’t enough. By providing real-time
                            visibility and custom reporting tools with visual representative support, ACPL helped the
                            government move from a reactive model to a proactive one, making monitoring smarter, faster,
                            and far more effective.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pb-3">
                            In most projects, reports come at the end. For us, they became a way to begin to ask better
                            questions, to intervene earlier, to make decisions grounded in reality.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pb-4">
                            We turned a system that used to wait and react into one that could watch and respond.
                            And sometimes, that’s what makes the biggest difference.
