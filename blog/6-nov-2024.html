                        <p class="pb-3">Managing employee attendance in a workplace, no matter the size, is no small
                            task, as we’re sure you would agree. Things have greatly improved through the years in the
                            way companies are now tracking employee attendance with the help of evolving technology, but
                            there are still quite a few issues that business owners, managers, and HR face in this
                            space.</p>
                        <p class="pb-4">Attendance tracking is not just a formality in the workplace. It has a
                            deep-rooted purpose to understand your employees’ behaviour. Right from ensuring compliance
                            with leave policies, measuring tardiness & absenteeism, to their overall compensation
                            calculation, a smart attendance system can help you save countless man-hours.</p>
                        <p class="pb-4">And it’s not just management which benefits from these systems, your employees
                            will thank you for having a smooth, automated, and easy-to-use attendance tracking system
                            for them.</p>
                        <p class="pb-4">Let’s take a look at why these systems matter and how they can benefit everyone
                            in the workplace.</p>

                        <h4 class="pb-4 fs-32 fw-semibold">Top benefits for Employers, Managers, and HR:</h4>
                        <h5 class="pb-3 fs-28 fw-semibold lh-sm">More efficient, more accurate</h5>
                        <p class="pb-4">These smart attendance systems are a game-changer for employers everywhere.
                            These systems minimise human error to almost zero and completely eliminate unethical
                            practices such as proxy or buddy punching (where an employee can clock in for another by
                            entering their pass-code or signing on the register). All of this while maintaining highly
                            accurate employee attendance records. This data is stored in the system and can be easily
                            retrieved by management for tracking, payroll, and leave calculation in real-time.</p>

                        <h5 class="pb-3 fs-28 fw-semibold lh-sm">Real-time monitoring and reporting</h5>
                        <p class="pb-4">Advanced employee attendance tracking systems like the VIGIL PROX allow very
                            easy real-time data transfer via TCP/IP protocol, making it more streamlined for management
                            to monitor employee attendance remotely. VIGIL PROX’s contactless smart card reader works
                            seamlessly with online data transfers, providing accurate time management and supporting
                            both indoor and outdoor installations. By allowing remote access to attendance data, it
                            becomes easier for managers to track attendance trends and address any issues, such as
                            absenteeism, early departures, or late arrivals.</p>

                        <h5 class="pb-3 fs-28 fw-semibold lh-sm">Flexibility for different work environments</h5>
                        <p class="pb-5">As more companies adopt flexible, remote, and hybrid working policies,
                            cloud-based attendance systems are becoming more of a ‘need’ than simply a ‘want’. Smart
                            systems that support remote check-ins allow employees to log their work hours from different
                            locations, reducing friction for those who may not be working at the office every day. This
                            setup also enables companies to manage workforce attendance for field employees or those at
                            different sites, creating a more inclusive full-scope attendance management system.</p>


                        <h4 class="pb-4 fs-32 fw-semibold">Top Benefits For Employees:</h4>
                        <h5 class="pb-3 fs-28 fw-semibold lh-sm">A simpler, easier process</h5>
                        <p class="pb-4">Gone are the days of manually logging time in a register or swiping a punch
                            card. This is the era of forward-thinking tech. And having such technology in your workplace
                            creates a positive impression among your workforce. If your employees can use biometrics
                            (such as fingerprint) or smart cards to register their attendance in seconds, why rely on
                            outdated methods?</p>
                        <img class="w-100 pb-5"
                            src="../assets/images/access-computech/blogs/2024/November-2024/6-Nov-2024/blog-image.jpg"
                            alt="">
                        <p class="pb-3">
                            This ease of use saves a lot of time and minimises wait times during the peak hours
                            (reporting time and leaving time), making it especially helpful in large organisations and
                            busy or fast-moving work environments such as factories and warehouses.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pb-4">One popular solution in this space, FP 900, offers both fingerprint and smart
                            card authentication, providing employees with quick, touchless access to work premises. With
                            a powerful optical fingerprint sensor, FP 900 ensures accurate and secure attendance
                            tracking. Its robust memory can store up to 10,000 user templates, so employees’ information
                            is safely stored and easily accessible.</p>
                        <h5 class="pb-3 fs-28 fw-semibold lh-sm">Much better privacy and security</h5>
                        <p class="pb-4">Biometric systems offer a more secure way to handle access and attendance, as
                            they rely on unique identifiers like fingerprints rather than passcodes or badges, which can
                            be easily lost or shared. This adds a layer of security that protects employees’ data and
                            contributes to overall workplace safety. Employees as well as employers can rest easy by
                            knowing that only authorised individuals can access certain areas, which can be particularly
                            important in industries dealing with sensitive information, such as finance, research, and
                            IT.</p>
                        <h5 class="pb-3 fs-28 fw-semibold lh-sm">Supporting regulatory compliance and transparency</h5>
                        <p class="pb-3">Under the Employees' Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952,
                            employers In India are required to maintain records of salary and attendance for a minimum
                            period of five years.</p>
                        <p class="pb-3">Our country’s labour laws also require businesses to maintain accurate
                            attendance records. Smart attendance systems help ensure compliance by automatically
                            generating time logs, which are valuable during audits or legal checks. These detailed
                            reports also aid in building transparency in employee attendance, thereby creating a culture
                            of trust between employees and employers.</p>
                        <p class="pb-5">With the FP 900 and VIGIL PROX systems, companies can effortlessly maintain
                            records, monitor working hours, and generate reports with ease. FP 900, for instance,
                            features customisable Wiegand formats, allowing companies to tailor the data output to meet
                            specific regulatory or internal needs.</p>

                        <h4 class="pb-3 fs-32 fw-semibold">A Future-Ready Investment for Companies</h4>
                        <p class="pb-4">As Indian workplaces continue to evolve, smart employee attendance systems are a
                            valuable investment. They simplify HR processes, reduce errors, and enhance workplace
                            security, all while creating a more streamlined experience for employees. For companies,
                            smart attendance systems like VIGIL PROX and FP 900 will not only improve productivity but
                            also adapt easily to future changes in workforce management.</p>
