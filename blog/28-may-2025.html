                        <p class="pb-3">
                            Manual register-based attendance is still widely used. However, it has many flaws, despite
                            its worldwide acceptance. But the one flaw that has the potential to discredit the entire
                            system is proxy attendance. Whether it be the student's attendance or the staff’s.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pb-3">
                            In manual methods, proxying is very easy to do, even harder to detect, and almost impossible
                            to challenge.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pb-3">
                            A student’s friend could mark them present. A teacher could just fill out the entire list at
                            the end of the week. Or a staff member could misuse it to mark working days despite being
                            away from work.
                            A few numbers change, and it’s nearly impossible to prove what really happened.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pb-3">
                            It’s not that the system was broken because people weren’t working. The real problem was
                            that there was no way to know if what was on paper matched what happened in real life.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pb-3">
                            So that’s what we had set out to fix. Not with the intention of any suspicion or
                            surveillance, but with a simple idea to let the system verify itself.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pb-4">
                            Our solution reduced a lot of admin workload, divided responsibility on crucial processes
                            such as attendance marking, and automated the monitoring and analysis of attendance trends
                            and patterns in the state’s schools.
                        </p>

                        <h5 class="pb-3 fs-28 fw-semibold lh-sm">The Challenge</h5>
                        <p class="pb-3">
                            Across Gujarat’s government schools, attendance was still being recorded by hand. This
                            meant:
                        </p>
                        <ul class="pb-3 ps-lg-5 ps-0" style="list-style:disc;">
                            <li class="pb-2">A student could be marked present even if they never entered the classroom.
                            </li>
                            <li class="pb-2">Teachers might submit backdated entries under pressure.</li>
                            <li class="pb-2">Records could be manipulated, lost, or changed after the fact.</li>
                            <li class="pb-2">Staff could mark themselves present even when on holiday.</li>
                            <li class="pb-2">Discrepancies in attendance could not be flagged immediately.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="pb-3">
                            The bigger problem? These records were the foundation for decision-making. This data was
                            used to evaluate performance reviews and for resource allocation. Student interventions and
                            policies were set based on this data. And yet, the system was almost entirely dependent on
                            unverifiable human memory.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pb-4">
                            We needed to shift the idea of attendance from being an assumption to being a fact.
                        </p>

                        <h5 class="pb-3 fs-28 fw-semibold lh-sm">The ACPL Solution</h5>
                        <p class="pb-3">
                            We replaced manual registers with a biometric fingerprint-based system. This one change made
                            attendance irrefutable.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pb-3">
                            At the core of the solution was a principle: you can only mark your attendance if you’re
                            physically present, and only if the system confirms it’s you.
                        </p>

                        <h6 class="pb-2 fw-semibold">Fingerprint-Based Verification</h6>
                        <p class="pb-3">
                            Every student and teacher was enrolled in the system with their fingerprint, captured and
                            stored securely at the school level.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pb-3">
                            When they arrived each day, they simply scanned their registered finger at a device
                            connected to the school’s system. The match had to be exact, or the entry wouldn’t register.
                        </p>

                        <p class="pb-3">
                            For the first time, school attendance became something you could trust completely.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pb-3">
                            Teachers could no longer be held responsible for manually chasing records or verifying
                            student presence.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pb-3">
                            District officers didn’t have to wait a month to know if attendance was slipping.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pb-3">
                            And students? They knew the system couldn’t be gamed. They had to show up to be counted.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pb-3">
                            The impact was clear as day.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pb-4">
                            Attendance started going up because the system didn’t discriminate anymore.
                            Patterns started to emerge, which will help the government create and implement relevant
                            education policies for years to come.

                            Sometimes, fixing a problem isn’t about catching people, it’s about removing the opportunity
                            for the problem to happen in the first place.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pb-3">
                            Proxy attendance was much more than a technical flaw. It was a gap in trust, accountability,
                            and clarity.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pb-4">
                            By putting identity verification at the centre of the system, we completely eliminated fake
                            entries and made every single attendance count. And that, in turn, made the whole system
                            stronger.
