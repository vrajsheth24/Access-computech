                            Are you a small business owner tied down to one spot because of your bulky cash register?
                            What if there's a simple device that fits in your pocket and can take payments anywhere in
                            your store, at trade shows, exhibition stalls, or even when you are delivering products to
                            customers?
                        </p>

                        <h5 class="pb-3 fs-28 fw-semibold lh-sm">What makes Mobile POS Systems different?</h5>
                        <p class="pb-3">
                            So what exactly is a mobile POS system? Think of it as a cash register, but tiny and
                            wireless. Instead of a customer walking towards your counter, you walk to them with this
                            handheld device.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pb-4">
                            Regular POS Systems are usually stuck at one place. They need wires, take up crucial counter
                            space, and to be honest, they make your store look outdated.
                            Mobile POS systems are a game changer. They're wireless, fit in your hand, and they connect
                            to the internet just like a smartphone.
                            The best part? Your customers can pay with cards, phones or even UPI right where they're
                            standing. No more stuck up long lines at the checkout counter.
                        </p>

                        <h5 class="pb-3 fs-28 fw-semibold lh-sm">Top 5 Benefits mobile POS System brings to small
                            businesses
                        </h5>
                        <p class="pb-4">
                            Let's break this down to five biggest advantages of a mobile POS device.
                        </p>

                            <h5 class="pb-3 fs-22 fw-semibold">1. Faster Checkout Times</h5>
                            <p class="pb-3">
                                Studies show that mobile POS systems can cut checkout times by up to 30%. This
                                efficiency
                                can be particularly beneficial in busy ecosystems, where long queues can deter
                                customers. If
                                you run a restaurant, you can take payments right at their table, or right where they're
                                shopping if you have a retail store.
                            </p>

                                they're happy. Happy customers are repeat customers.

                            Let's talk numbers now.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pb-3">
                            Traditional POS Systems can cost anywhere from ₹15000 to ₹35000 just to get started. Then
                            you have a monthly fee, maintenance costs, and if something breaks, you're looking at
                            expensive repairs.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pb-3">
                            Mobile POS systems start at around ₹5000 to ₹7000 and the transaction fees are usually lower
                            too. Most small businesses save about 2000 to 5000 Rupees per month just on processing fees
                            alone.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pb-4">
                            However, let's talk about the real savings: Time
                            If you're spending 30 minutes at the end of every day, managing payments and inventory,
                            that's 15 working hours per month.
                            As a business owner your time is valuable and these 15 hours per month can be used to grow
                            your business instead of fighting with old technology.

                        <h5 class="pb-3 fs-28 fw-semibold lh-sm">What to look for when buying a Mobile POS system?</h5>
                        <p class="pb-3">
                            Here are the key things to check when you're shopping for a mobile POS device:
                        </p>
                        <ul class="pb-4 ps-lg-5 ps-0" style="list-style:disc;">
                            <li class="pb-2">Battery life is important: You don't want your device dying during your
                                busy hours or getting stuck at one place to get charged. Look for devices that can last
                                a full business day, at least.</li>
                            <li class="pb-2">Internet Connectivity: There are options available for devices that work
                                with Mobile data, WiFi or even Bluetooth like F360. This means you can take payments
                                even if your WiFi goes down.</li>
                            <li class="pb-2">Durability: Small Business owner life is tough and look for devices that
                                are built to handle the tough, just like you. It should be able to handle spills, drops,
                                man handling and daily wear. Look for devices with stellar build quality.</li>
                            <li class="pb-2">Good Customer Support: When you have questions or problems, help is needed
                                fast and immediate. Prefer companies that provide phone support in your local languages.
                            </li>
                            <li class="pb-2">Reasonable Service Costs: Do not draw a comparison just on the basis of
                                device cost. Check and compare monthly charges, processing fees and any other hidden
                                charges as well.</li>
                        </ul>
